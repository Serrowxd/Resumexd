## Notes

* Redoing the landing with React-Spring - considering transition pages? Like 1 page, but then a transition for each of the components. The Nav might not need to exist, could just remove it and add a "Home" button that allows the user to go back. Or just make the outer div a "Home" link. **FINISHED**

* create buttons for the landing page, rename it and adjust the transition. **CURRENT**

## Issues

* Links are way taller than expected - might be an issue with Router? They don't sit within the buttons, the extend far above them causing issues with clicking.
